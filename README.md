# rufusmaiwald.de - digital business card

View: [rufusmaiwald.de](https://rufusmaiwald.de)

This site aims to be a digital business card and shows some information about me as developer.

### Development

It's developed with the javascript framework [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and made to a Single Page Application (SPA) using vue-router.   
The style utilizises [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) in combination with [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org).
It's made fully responsive for all possible screen sizes.   
For outgoing requests I utilize [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) as a promise based ajax library. 
The data are then processed with the vue helper functions.   
The whole site is made as a [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) 
and can be added to the home screen on mobile browsers and to the desktop since [Chrome 73](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/desktop)

### Hosting

The site is hosted using the free web service of [render](https://render.com/).   
Github pages is not useful as it does not natively support SPAs.
